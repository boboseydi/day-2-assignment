    LottoPicker will generate and print out 5 random whole integers between 0-30 to the user
        1 - figure out how to generate a random integer
        2 - repeat step 1, 5 times
        3 - we need to store the results of step 2
        4 - we need to find a way to print the results that were stored along the way

        Programming is the combination of iteratives and conditionals
              Iteratives - repeating a process over and over
              Conditionals - checking a condition (true/false) to decide what to do or if I should keep doing something

         Control Flow - Different types of statements that affect the flow of a program
              Iterative - loops:
                    while loop - while a condition is true, keep executing
                    do while loop - similar to a while loop, guaranteed to run once

              Condition -
                    if - checks if a condition is true, if it is it will execute once
                    else - executes if an if statement evaluates to false
